add automation for cert renewal on server
try to understand what was the issue in greece
check out server logs  of backups, there is a bug there somewhere
BUG client: when today has more than one day info, timed ones have to go highers - meaning, everything in today must have today's date (and keep previous time?)
server: add backup of entries every day at same hour. keep backwards 3 months.
mobile: add clickable links
server: make API responses more accurate (status and message)
client: show the error from server's responses

client: add ability to see previous server logs
client: add UI option to set how far back logs/backups are saved
mobile: optimize load speed and swipe reaction speed
server + clients: improve client authentication - not send creds on every request?
server: add brute force protection for authentication (per user and per ip)
feature: notifications for entries (through app? google calendar?)
client: add undo for web app
feature: host an example calendar on the server?

feature: consider serving the website and not locally
