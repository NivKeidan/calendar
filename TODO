client: make savings to server more efficient (accumulate requests)
client bug: edit date on an entry and set a passed date. you get 2.2.22 set
client: add border around each entry (this requires to finding a proper solution for the draggable spaces)
client: when editing time/date the row gets more height and everything below that row moves. this is ugly and not smooth.

deployment: make server a service
server: add backup of entries every day at same hour. keep backwards 3 months.
mobile: add clickable links
